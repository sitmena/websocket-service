## WebSocket Service

### Description

The WebSocket Service is designed to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. Using the WebSocket protocol, this service facilitates efficient and low-latency interactions, making it ideal for applications requiring continuous, live data updates such as chat applications, live notifications, gaming, or financial trading platforms.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Establishes a persistent connection for real-time data exchange without repeated HTTP requests.
- **Bidirectional Data Flow**: Allows both client and server to send messages independently.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Reduces latency and bandwidth by maintaining an open connection.
- **Scalable**: Supports a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with various frontend and backend services.

### Use Cases

- **Chat Applications**: Enables real-time messaging between users.
- **Live Notifications**: Provides instant updates on events or changes.
- **Online Gaming**: Facilitates real-time interactions and game state updates.
- **Financial Trading**: Delivers live updates on stock prices and trading activity.

### How It Works

1. **Connection Establishment**: The client initiates a WebSocket connection, which is established over a single TCP connection.
2. **Data Exchange**: Both client and server can send messages at any time, allowing real-time updates.
3. **Connection Management**: The connection remains open for continuous data exchange until explicitly closed.

### Configuration

- **Ports**: Exposes the necessary ports for WebSocket communication.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure environment-specific settings, such as public keys or other sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Designed to efficiently handle multiple connections with options for scaling.
